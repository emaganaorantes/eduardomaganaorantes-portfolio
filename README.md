# Eduardo Magaña Orantes – Portfolio

Welcome to my engineering and computational science portfolio! Here I showcase several technical projects highlighting my skills in simulation, data analysis, and machine learning.

## About Me

I am an enthusiastic aerospace engineering student with hands-on experience in numerical modeling, simulation, and scientific programming. These are a few of my most outstanding projects that I have done during my college time. My projects span MATLAB and Python, covering topics from physical system simulation to neural network-based PDE solvers.
